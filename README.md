Test project

One person who is so memorial to me is Sunny, who was my math teacher in high school.
First of all, he was always there for me when I needed help.
For example, whenever I had troble in my math, he helped me out and motivated me to study hard. 
Without him, I could not have finished a math course.
Another reason is that he was a greate person as well as a greate teacher.
Not only did he teach math but he also showed me how to be better human being.
He made me what I am tody.
